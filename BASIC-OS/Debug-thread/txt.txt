What is worker_threads in Node.js?
ðŸ”¹ English:
worker_threads is a module in Node.js that allows you to run JavaScript code in parallel threads, separate from the main thread.

ðŸ”¹ Hindi:
worker_threads ek Node.js ka module hai jo aapko multiple threads me alag-alag JavaScript code chalane deta hai â€” matlab real multi-threading.

âœ… Why use it?
Node.js is single-threaded by default (event loop). But for:

CPU-intensive work (like large loops, image processing, encryption),

we can use worker_threads to run heavy code in separate threads.

ðŸ”§ Your Code:

const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");

new Worker("./a");
new Worker("./b");
new Worker("./c");
ðŸŽ¯ What it means:
You are creating 3 parallel workers (threads).

Each worker will execute its own file:

a.js

b.js

c.js

âœ… So 3 threads will run in parallel without blocking the main thread.

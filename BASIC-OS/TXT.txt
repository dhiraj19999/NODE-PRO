An operating system (OS) is a software that manages computer hardware and software resources, acting as a 
bridge between the user and the machine's hardware. A kernel is the core of the OS, a program that manages 
system resources, hardware, and processes. Think of the OS as the overall system, while the kernel is its central,
 essential part.
 In an operating system (OS), the kernel is the core software that manages hardware resources, and a process
  is a running instance of a program. The kernel acts as the intermediary between hardware and user 
  applications, handling tasks like memory allocation, process scheduling, and device control. Processes 
  are the active units of execution, and the kernel manages their creation, termination, and communication.

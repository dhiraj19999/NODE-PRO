🧠 Introduction to Data Representation in Computing

💡 What is Data Representation?
In computing, data representation refers to the way data is stored, processed, and transferred using binary (0s and 1s), because computers only understand electrical signals that translate into ON (1) or OFF (0) states.

🧱 Why Binary?
Computers use transistors, which are tiny switches that are either ON or OFF.
Binary makes it easy to represent:
ON = 1
OFF = 0

✍️ Text Representation
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):
Represents characters as 7-bit binary numbers.
Example: 'A' = 65 → 01000001
Unicode (UTF-8, UTF-16):
Supports characters from all languages and symbols.
More flexible and widely used today.

🧊 Everything is Bits
No matter if it’s text, images, music, or video — all data inside a computer is ultimately stored and manipulated as binary digits (bits).


 Decimal Number System

🧠 What is it?
The Decimal Number System is the standard system we use in everyday life.
It’s called decimal because it’s based on 10 digits:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

🔢 Why Base 10?
Since there are 10 digits, the system uses powers of 10 to represent values based on their position (place value).

🧮 Place Values
Take the number 5642 as an example:
Digit
Place
Value Calculation
Final Value
5
Thousands
5 × 1000
5000
6
Hundreds
6 × 100
600
4
Tens
4 × 10
40
2
Units
2 × 1
2


Total
5642

So:
5642 = (5 × 10³) + (6 × 10²) + (4 × 10¹) + (2 × 10⁰)



🧮 Octal Number System (Base 8)

🔢 What is it?
The Octal Number System is a base-8 system.
It uses only 8 digits:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

📐 Why Base 8?
Because there are 8 unique digits, values are calculated using powers of 8 instead of 10.
For example, the octal number 125 means:
1 × 8² + 2 × 8¹ + 5 × 8⁰ = 64 + 16 + 5 = 85 in decimal

🚫 Octal in JavaScript (Modern Syntax)
In older JavaScript versions (pre-ES6), you could write octal numbers like 012, but this is now deprecated.
✅ In modern JavaScript (ES6+), use the 0o prefix for octal literals:
let oct = 0o12; // 10 in decimal
console.log(oct); // Output: 10

📥 parseInt() with Octal
You can parse octal strings using parseInt with a radix:
parseInt("12", 8); 
// Output: 10 (as 1×8 + 2 = 10)
// The second argument 8 tells parseInt that the string is in base-8.

📤 Converting to Octal
Using .toString(8) will convert a number to octal:
let num = 85;
console.log(num.toString(8)); 
// Output: "125"

🧑💻 Practical Usage
Rarely used in day-to-day JavaScript
Still used behind the scenes in Linux, especially for file permissions
Example: chmod 755 file.txt → Octal permission notation


🧮 Hexadecimal Number System (Base-16)
The Hexadecimal system (often abbreviated as Hex) is a Base-16 number system.
It uses 16 unique symbols to represent numbers:
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,A, B, C, D, E, F
The letters A to F represent values from 10 to 15 in decimal:
A = 10, B = 11, ..., F = 15

📌 Why Use Hex?
Compact representation of large binary numbers.
Frequently used in:
Memory addresses
Colors in CSS (#FF5733)
Low-level programming (e.g., device drivers, embedded systems)

✅ Syntax in JavaScript
const hex = 0x1A; 
// Hexadecimal 1A = Decimal 26
console.log(hex); // Output: 26
0x is the prefix used to define a hexadecimal number in JavaScript.

🔄 Conversions
1. Hex → Decimal
console.log(parseInt("1A", 16)); // Output: 26
"1A" is a hex string.
1 × 16 + 10 = 26
2. Decimal → Hex
const num = 255;
console.log(num.toString(16)); // Output: "ff"
Converts a decimal number to hexadecimal.

The Binary Number System is the foundation of all computing systems.
It consists of only two digits:
0 and 1
Therefore, it's known as a Base-2 number system.

⚙️ Why Binary?
Computers use electrical signals which are either on or off.
These states are easily represented by:
1 → ON
0 → OFF
All data in a computer—text, images, videos, and more—is ultimately stored and processed in binary.

✅ Binary in JavaScript
const binary = 0b1010; // Binary for decimal 10
console.log(binary);   // Output: 10
0b is the prefix used to denote a binary literal in JavaScript.

🔢 Mathematical Operations on Binary
Just like decimal numbers, we can perform:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Example:
const a = 0b101;     // 5 in decimal
const b = 0b011;     // 3 in decimal
console.log(a + b);  // Output: 8


Binary Number: 101
Binary is base-2. That means each digit (bit) represents a power of 2, from right to left.

makefile
Copy
Edit
Binary:     1   0   1
Place:      2^2 2^1 2^0
Values:     4 + 0 + 1 = 5
Breakdown:
1 × 2² = 4

0 × 2¹ = 0

1 × 2⁰ = 1

So:


101 (binary) = 4 + 0 + 1 = 5 (decimal)


📦 Digital Data Units (with Clarification)
Just like we measure physical things (length in meters, weight in kilograms),
digital data also has its own measurement units.

🧠 Philosophical Insight:
While we can't measure the smallest creation of nature (like a soul or consciousness),
we can measure the smallest unit of data — something created by humans.

🧮 Base Units
Unit	Value
1 Bit	Smallest unit of data (0 or 1)
4 Bits	1 Nibble (Half Byte)
8 Bits	1 Byte

🌐 Two Systems of Measurement
1️⃣ SI (International System of Units)
Base: 10 → Powers of 10
Used by manufacturers, shows larger sizes (but technically less data than IEC).

Unit	Meaning	Bytes
1 KB	1 Kilobyte	1,000 Bytes (10³)
1 MB	1 Megabyte	1,000,000 Bytes (10⁶)
1 GB	1 Gigabyte	1,000,000,000 Bytes (10⁹)
1 TB	1 Terabyte	1,000,000,000,000 Bytes (10¹²)

2️⃣ IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
Base: 2 → Powers of 2
Used by operating systems and programmers, actual usable data shown here.

Unit	Meaning	Bytes
1 KiB	1 Kibibyte	1,024 Bytes (2¹⁰)
1 MiB	1 Mebibyte	1,048,576 Bytes (2²⁰)
1 GiB	1 Gibibyte	1,073,741,824 Bytes (2³⁰)
1 TiB	1 Tebibyte	1,099,511,627,776 Bytes (2⁴⁰)

❗ Common Confusion
Term	Often Misunderstood As	Actual (IEC) Value
1 Kilobyte (KB)	1,000 Bytes	❌ It's not 1,024 Bytes
1 Kibibyte (KiB)	1,024 Bytes	✅ Correct binary form
1 Megabyte (MB)	1,000,000 Bytes	❌ It's not 1,048,576 Bytes
1 Mebibyte (MiB)	1,048,576 Bytes	✅ Correct binary form
1 Gigabyte (GB)	1,000,000,000 Bytes	❌ It's not 1,073,741,824 Bytes
1 Gibibyte (GiB)	1,073,741,824 Bytes	✅ Correct binary form

🧾 Real-World Example:
A 1TB hard drive (manufacturer labeled in SI) appears as only ~931GB on your computer (which reads in IEC).
The missing space? Just the difference between TB vs TiB.



🔁 Signed vs Unsigned Binary Numbers
📌 Basics
Computers represent numbers in binary.

But binary alone doesn't indicate whether a number is positive or negative.

That's where Signed and Unsigned concepts come in.

🔢 Unsigned Binary
Can store only non-negative values.

Entire bit space is used to represent magnitude.

✅ 8-bit Unsigned Range:
0 to 255 (2⁸ = 256 possible values)

🔁 Signed Binary (2's Complement)
Used to represent both positive and negative numbers.

The most significant bit (MSB) is reserved as the sign bit:

0 → positive number

1 → negative number

✅ 8-bit Signed Range:
-128 to +127
(Still 256 values, but split between negative and positive)

✍️ How is a Negative Number Stored?
If MSB is 1, it is assumed to be negative, and system uses 2’s complement to get the actual value.

🧮 2’s Complement (Method to Get Negative Value)
To find 2's complement of a binary number:

Flip all bits (i.e., 0 → 1, 1 → 0)

Add 1 to the result

Example:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
Positive:   00000101  → 5

Flip:       11111010  
Add 1:      11111011  → -5 (2's complement representation)
So 11111011 is how -5 is stored in an 8-bit signed buffer.

⚠️ Important Note
For 0 to 127, signed and unsigned binary are the same, because the MSB is 0.

But from 128 to 255, they differ:

In unsigned: It's just 128–255

In signed: It's actually -128 to -1 (interpreted using 2’s complement)

💡 What is MSB?
MSB stands for Most Significant Bit.

In a binary number, it's the leftmost bit — the bit with the highest place value.

🔍 Example (8-bit binary):
makefile
Copy
Edit
Binary:  1  0  0  0  0  0  0  1
         ↑

         🧾 In Signed Numbers:
MSB = 0 → number is positive

MSB = 1 → number is negative (using 2’s complement)

👉 Unsigned (only +ve numbers):
All 8 bits used for magnitude

Max value = 2⁸ - 1 = 255

Range = 0 to 255

👉 Signed (positive + negative numbers using 2's complement):
1 bit (MSB) reserved for sign

Remaining 7 bits for magnitude

Range = -128 to +127




Signed = positive + negative (MSB = sign bit)

📌 Short Answer for Interview:
"Signed numbers use the most significant bit to represent 
sign (0 = positive, 1 = negative), while unsigned numbers 
store only positive values."


📀 Binary Data on Physical Level

🔢 How Data is Stored as 0s and 1s
Digital data is ultimately stored and represented in binary (0s and 1s). This is achieved through physical means using various hardware technologies.

📁 Two Broad Categories:
Data Storage
Data Transfer

🧠 Data Storage
✅ Basic Concept:
At the physical level, data is stored using transistors, where:
Charge present → 1
No charge → 0

🧲 In Hard Disk Drives (HDD):
Magnetic plates (platters) are used.
Magnetic poles represent binary:
North pole → 1
South pole → 0
HDD Internal Design:
Inside is a circular disk called a Platter.
A needle-like arm reads/writes data.
RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) is a key speed factor:
Common values: 5400 RPM, 7200 RPM (higher is faster).
Because of moving parts, HDDs:
Are bigger in size
Are cheaper
Produce noise
Are prone to mechanical failure

💾 In Solid State Drives (SSD):
Use memory chips (likely transistors) — no moving parts.
Faster than HDDs.
More reliable and quiet (no fans or moving parts).
Smaller in size, but more expensive.

📡 Data Transfer
🌐 Wireless (EM Waves):
Uses Electromagnetic Waves like Radio Waves.
Binary data is encoded as:
High/Low Amplitudes
Different Frequencies
🔌 Wired:
Fiber Optic Cables:
Use light:
Light pulse = 1
No light = 0
Copper Wires:
Use electric voltage:
High voltage = 1
Low voltage = 0

🖼️ How Media is Stored (Images, Videos, Music)
Physically, only binary data (0s and 1s) is stored.
This binary is encoded in formats interpretable as:
Images (.png, .jpg)
Videos (.mp4, .mov)
Audio (.mp3, .wav)
Text (.txt, .docx)
Each file format follows specific encoding rules which tell software how to decode and display the actual content.
The interpretation (not storage) is what differs based on file type.

🧾 Fun Fact:
The term bit stands for Binary Digit — the smallest unit of data in computing.



🔢 Why Do We Use Decimal Number System?
🧠 Human Adoption:
We use the Decimal Number System (Base-10) primarily because:
Humans have 10 fingers — a natural counting tool.
It made early counting, trading, and record-keeping intuitive and easy.
The place value concept (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) became widely accepted and used in education, accounting, and daily life.
💡 Historical Insight:
The ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer), one of the earliest computers, actually used decimal representation instead of binary internally.
This shows that decimal was the natural choice for early engineers too.
🖥️ Why Do Computers Use Octal and Hexadecimal Number Systems?
📌 Binary Compatibility:
Computers operate on Binary (Base-2) because their hardware (transistors) can only represent two states: ON (1) and OFF (0).
However, binary numbers get long and hard to read for humans. So, to simplify:
Octal (Base-8) and Hexadecimal (Base-16) are used for grouping binary digits.
🧮 Powers of 2:
Octal: 2³ = 8 → 1 octal digit = 3 binary digits
Hexadecimal: 2⁴ = 16 → 1 hex digit = 4 binary digits
This compact grouping allows easier reading, debugging, and memory address representation in computing.


✳️ Character Set vs Character Encoding
📘 Character Set
A Character Set is a collection of characters and the codes assigned to represent them.
It defines which characters exist — letters, digits, symbols, control characters, etc.
✅ Popular Character Sets:
ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange):
Supports 128 characters
Uses 7 bits to represent characters → 2⁷ = 128
Includes: A–Z, a–z, 0–9, punctuation, and control characters
Unicode:
A much larger set capable of representing over 1.1 million characters
Supports characters from all major languages, emojis, symbols, etc.
🧠 Character Encoding
Character Encoding defines how characters from the set are represented as binary data (0s and 1s).
It is the actual implementation that translates characters into bytes.
🧾 Examples:
ASCII Encoding:
Uses 7 bits per character
Encodes only ASCII character set
UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8 bit):
Variable-length encoding (1 to 4 bytes)
Backward-compatible with ASCII (first 128 characters are same)
Most popular Unicode encoding today (used in HTML, web, etc.)


🧠 UTF-8 Encoding in Depth
🧪 Tools to Explore UTF-8 Internals:
To understand how data is converted and stored in UTF-8, we can use these terminal commands:

xxd <filename>
→ Displays the hexadecimal (Unicode-like) content of a file in groups of two bytes.

xxd -g 1 <filename>
→ Displays the hex content grouped per byte (very useful for byte-level analysis).

xxd -b <filename>
→ Displays the binary representation of each byte in the file.

🔧 Bonus: Install a Hex Editor extension in your code editor (e.g., VSCode) to visually inspect the bytes of a file.

🔁 When Does Encoding Happen?
Encoding is applied in two phases:

Saving the file: Your text editor encodes characters into bytes based on the specified encoding (e.g., UTF-8).

Opening the file: The reader (another program or system) decodes the bytes back to characters using the same encoding.

🧬 UTF-8 Encoding Characteristics
UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding.
It uses 1 to 4 bytes depending on the character.

It’s backward compatible with ASCII.
Characters up to U+007F (127) are stored using a single byte (0xxxxxxx), just like ASCII.

🔡 UTF-8 Byte Format Rules:
Character Range	Bytes Used	Binary Format	Description
U+0000 – U+007F	1 byte	0xxxxxxx	ASCII compatible
U+0080 – U+07FF	2 bytes	110xxxxx 10xxxxxx	For Latin, Greek, etc.
U+0800 – U+FFFF	3 bytes	1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx	For most common languages
U+10000 – U+10FFFF	4 bytes	11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx	For emojis, rare symbols

✅ Note: The 1s in prefixes (like 110, 1110, etc.) are used to identify the byte count and are not part of the character value.

📁 Real-World Use Case
If you read a file using fs.readFile() in Node.js, it gives you a buffer. That buffer contains these raw UTF-8 encoded byte values. If you print that buffer in hexadecimal or binary, you’ll see exactly how each character was stored.



UTF-8 converts any text (from any language) into binary (0s and 1s) so that a computer can store, transmit, or display it properly.


🔁 How it works:
🌐 Language Text	🔤 Characters	⚙️ UTF-8 Converts to	💾 Binary Form
Hello	English	UTF-8 bytes	01001000 01100101 ...
नमस्ते	Hindi	UTF-8 multi-byte	1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx...
你好	Chinese	UTF-8 multi-byte	More binary bytes
❤️	Emoji	UTF-8 multi-byte	Even more binary bytes

🧩 UTF-8 vs UTF-16
📌 Full Form:
UTF stands for Unicode Transformation Format

🔁 UTF-8:
Uses 1 to 4 bytes (variable-length encoding)

Characters in the ASCII range (0–127) use only 1 byte

Higher Unicode characters use 2, 3, or 4 bytes

Uses headers (prefix bits) to determine byte length:

1 byte: 0xxxxxxx

2 bytes: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx

3 bytes: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

4 bytes: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

More memory efficient for English-heavy text (where characters fit in 1 byte)

Slightly slower for computation (due to decoding variable byte length)

🔁 UTF-16:
Uses 2 or 4 bytes

Default size = 2 bytes (16 bits) for most characters

For characters beyond U+FFFF, uses surrogate pairs (4 bytes)

Has two variants:

LE (Little Endian) – Least significant byte first

BE (Big Endian) – Most significant byte first

Does not use header bits, so decoding is faster and more consistent

May consume more memory than UTF-8 for ASCII-heavy content

📌 Endianness and Byte Order in Computers

🔁 Two Ways to Store Data
Data can be stored in two orders:
Least Significant Bit (LSB) at lower index — Little Endian
Most Significant Bit (MSB) at lower index — Big Endian
Just like how date formats differ (e.g., DD-MM-YYYY vs MM-DD-YYYY), endianness can vary between:
Manufacturers
Regions or countries

🔗 Why Endianness Matters in Networking
Different systems using different endianness can cause data misinterpretation during transfer.
To avoid this confusion, systems share the encoding format (like endianness) with the request.

🔸 Human vs Machine Preference
Format
Description
Big Endian
Most Significant Byte first (human-friendly)
Little Endian
Least Significant Byte first (machine-friendly)


📘 Where the Term "Endian" Comes From
The term comes from "Big-Endians" and "Little-Endians" in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (about how to eat eggs 😄).

🧭 BOM (Byte Order Mark) and Unicode
BOM is a special Unicode character (U+FEFF) that indicates:
Encoding (like UTF-8, UTF-16)
Endianness (in UTF-16/UTF-32)

📚 BOM Values:
Encoding
BOM (Hex)
Description
UTF-8
EF BB BF
Optional BOM (3 bytes)
UTF-16 LE
FF FE
Little Endian
UTF-16 BE
FE FF
Big Endian

🔸 These BOM values are stored at the beginning of a file as metadata.

💡 UTF-8 and BOM
UTF-8 uses variable-length encoding.
BOM in UTF-8 takes 3 bytes: EF BB BF
Even though UTF-8 doesn't require endianness, some editors include BOM for identification.

⚙️ Node.js and Endianness
Node.js only supports Little Endian
To check your system's endianness:
import os from 'node:os';
console.log(os.endianness());  // 'LE' or 'BE'

🧪 System Commands
Platform
Command
Description
Bash (Linux)
lscpu
Look for Byte Order
PowerShell
[BitConverter]::IsLittleEndian
Returns True if system is Little Endian
When sending data for telling the format we use 2 Bytes(Not exactly but 2 Unicode Characters -> U+FEFF)
	And it is called as Byte Order Mark (BOM)

	BOM for Little Endian -> U+FFFE
	BOM for Big Endian -> U+FEFF

	NodeJS only Supports LE(Little Endian)

	But in case of UTF-8, we can use BOM. but since it uses variable system and FFEF/FFFE are 3 Byte(16 Bits) Character.
	so it make 3 variable( EF BB BF ) for storing the BOM.

	We can check which endianness is our System using by os.endianness()
	Commands -> for bash lscpu, for powershell [BitConverter]::IsLittleEndian

    UTF-8 ek text encoding format hai jo har character ko unique binary (0s & 1s) me convert karta hai, taaki computer usse samajh sake aur duniya ki kisi bhi language ka text store/send kar sake.

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) ek purana text encoding system 



hai jo sirf English characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, symbols) ko 7-bit binary me represent karta hai — total 128 characters hi support karta hai.


Jab hum string data bhejte hai — jaise name=Dhiraj — toh wo directly as-is store nahi hota, balki:

✅ Pehle wo encoding format me convert hota hai (mostly UTF-8)
Ye encoding use hoti hai taki:

Data transmit ho sake safely

Database ya server correctly samajh sake har character ko

Special characters (jaise ₹, é, &, emojis) bhi break na ho ya galat na dikhaye

🔍 Example:
text
Copy
Edit
name = Dhiraj
Internally, UTF-8 isse kuch is tarah bytes me encode karega:

Character	UTF-8 Binary (bytes)
D	01000100
h	01101000
i	01101001
r	01110010
a	01100001
j	01101010

Ye binary form hi database ya network me actual store/transmit hoti hai.

🔁 Jab read karte ho:
Database se UTF-8 decode hota hai → string wapas Dhiraj ban jata hai.

Summary in one line:
Database me string direct text ke form me nahi, UTF-8 encoding ke binary form me store hoti hai — jise read karte waqt wapas decode kiya jata hai.

fs (File System) module me utf8 issliye use hota hai taaki:

✅ Jab file read/write karte ho:
1. Read karte waqt:
js
Copy
Edit
fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  console.log(data); // Read hoke readable string milti hai
});
Agar 'utf8' na do, to data binary (Buffer) form me milega.

'utf8' dene se data human-readable string ban jata hai.

🧑‍💻 Real-life use:
Jab fs module me file handle karte ho: ✅

Jab form data save karte ho database me: ✅

Jab API se data exchange hota hai (headers me Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8 hota hai): ✅
